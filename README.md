<h1>Profex's Warzone</h1>

Profex's Warzone is an Action Packed Multiplayer 2D Game Developed in Java 19.2. <br>
This Game if Free to Play, You Can Even Host Your Own Server and Enjoy Playing With Your Friends.<br>

<h2>What is it About?</h2>

In This Game You Fight Against Other Players in a Death-Match on a Map.<br>
The Player With the Most Kills Wins the Match.<br>
After the Match has Ended, a New One Starts on a New Map. (More Maps are in Progress)

<h2>Maps</h2>

So Far Only One Map is Available but More Maps Are in Progress. <br>
In the Future I Would Like to Add a Feature Which Would Allow Players To Make Their Own Maps.

<h3>Crossfire</h3>
Crossfire is the First (and Only) Map in the Game. The Map Displays Area Around Bunker.<br>
On This Map We Can Find Bunker, Heliport, Destroyed Tunnel and Houses. <br>

<h2>Combat</h2>
Player Spawns With Just a Basic Pistol But More weapons Can be Found on the Map or by Killing Other Players.
